        "3. SPACING BETWEEN RHYMING GROUPS = ONE BLANK LINE after each rhyming phrase group\n"
        "4. LYRIC LINE LENGTH - CRITICAL FOR SINGING:\n"
        "   - MAXIMUM 10-12 WORDS per line (easier to sing without mumbling)\n"
        "   - MAXIMUM 60 characters per line (fits natural breath phrasing)\n"
        "   - SHORT lines are SINGABLE lines\n"
        "   - LONG lines force singers to rush and mumble\n"
        "   - Each line should be ONE MUSICAL PHRASE/THOUGHT\n"
        "   - Examples of GOOD line length:\n"
        "     * 'In the silence, I hear' (5 words)\n"
        "     * 'A rhythm that's calling me' (5 words)\n"
        "     * 'The night is young and alive' (6 words)\n"
        "     * 'Oh, the music fills my soul' (6 words)\n"
        "   - Examples of BAD line length (TOO LONG - AVOID):\n"
        "     * 'In the velvet haze of twilight, stars align' (8 words, OK length but too poetic)\n"
        "     * 'A celestial map, guiding me to the rhythm's shrine' (10 words, too complex)\n"
        "     * 'Softly glowing embers of a fire that's yet to rise' (11 words, WAY TOO LONG)\n"
        "     * 'Illuminating the path where music meets the skies' (9 words, still too long)\n"
        "5. DO NOT put tags and lyrics on the same line\n"
        "6. DO NOT put multiple lyrics on the same line\n"
        "7. USE BLANK LINES to separate rhyming groups for clarity\n"

    creativity_guide = (
        "VOCABULARY & CREATIVITY RULES (CRITICAL FOR AVOIDING REPETITION):\n"
        "AVOID OVERUSED PHRASES - You must use diverse vocabulary throughout the song:\n"
        "- NEVER repeat phrases like 'feel the beat', 'heart beating', 'music alive', 'energy thrive' in the same song\n"
        "- NEVER use the same adjectives repeatedly (don't say 'young' and 'young', 'alive' and 'alive')\n"
        "- NEVER reuse the same verbs across multiple lines (avoid repeating 'feel', 'hear', 'dance', 'move')\n"
        "- Each verse/section should have COMPLETELY DIFFERENT vocabulary from other verses\n\n"
        "VOCABULARY DIVERSITY TECHNIQUES:\n"
        "1. USE SYNONYMS AND VARIED EXPRESSIONS:\n"
        "   Instead of repeating 'feel the beat':\n"
        "   - 'sense the rhythm', 'catch the pulse', 'surrender to the groove', 'ride the tempo'\n"
        "   - 'chase the bass', 'follow the drums', 'let the rhythm guide me'\n\n"
        "2. DESCRIBE DIFFERENT SENSATIONS:\n"
        "   Use varied sensory words:\n"
        "   - Visual: 'colors flash', 'lights spin', 'shadows dance', 'neon glow'\n"
        "   - Touch: 'skin alive', 'warmth rising', 'hands reaching', 'fingers moving'\n"
        "   - Emotional: 'soul soaring', 'mind spinning', 'spirit lifted', 'essence flowing'\n\n"
        "3. CREATE UNIQUE METAPHORS:\n"
        "   - Avoid clichés like 'heart beating to the music'\n"
        "   - Use fresh imagery: 'breathing with the synths', 'thoughts dissolving in sound'\n"
        "   - Mix unexpected comparisons: 'like rain on summer nights', 'like fire and ice colliding'\n\n"
        "4. VARY SENTENCE STRUCTURE:\n"
        "   - Don't use 'I feel...' for every line\n"
        "   - Alternate: 'Lights explode', 'My vision blurs', 'The music lifts me', 'Energy surrounds'\n"
        "   - Use questions, exclamations, statements, fragments\n\n"
        "5. BUILD VOCABULARY BANKS FOR DIFFERENT THEMES:\n"
        "   For energy/excitement: surge, ignite, explode, rush, ignition, burst, blaze, surge\n"
        "   For movement: glide, spiral, float, swirl, cascade, wave, undulate, propel\n"
        "   For sound: echo, resonate, vibrate, hum, throb, pulse, reverberate, sing\n"
        "   For emotion: soar, transcend, liberate, dissolve, awaken, illuminate, unlock\n\n"
        "SELF-CHECK BEFORE GENERATING:\n"
        "- If you use a word, DON'T use it again in the next 5 lines minimum\n"
        "- If you write 'feel', check you don't have it 2 lines away\n"
        "- Every section should feel like a NEW exploration of the theme\n"
        "- Think: Would a human lyricist write the same phrase 3 times in one song? NO!\n\n"
        "EXAMPLE OF POOR REPETITION (AVOID):\n"
        "  I feel the beat tonight\n"
        "  Feel the music in my heart\n"
        "  When I feel the rhythm strong\n"
        "  Dancing to this beat of mine\n\n"
        "EXAMPLE OF GOOD DIVERSITY (DO THIS):\n"
        "  I feel the beat tonight\n"
        "  Let the music fill my chest\n"
